  Run several Fuchsia workstreams (or several agents) on one machine without their builds, ffx

  up the wrong tree or targets the wrong device, or on cross-tree symptoms (two emulators fighting,

# fuchsia-multi-checkout — several Fuchsia workstreams on one machine

Goal: several agents working different topics concurrently without stepping on each other's builds,
ffx daemons, or target devices.

**Headline:** Fuchsia now ships **`fx worktree`** — first-class support for parallel workstreams
backed by a pool of physical checkouts. Prefer it for new workstreams. Hand-managed separate
checkouts still work and are still what most existing trees are; that path is documented near the
end. Either way, the **two conventions** below are what actually prevent collisions.

> Everything marked *verified* here was checked against a tree at integration `d952e26cd35`
> (root `e9ab7c44481`, 2026-08-15). `fx worktree` landed between 2026-06 and 2026-08 — a tree older
> than that will not have it, and `jiri update` is the prerequisite.

## `fx worktree` (preferred)

Verified command surface — read from `tools/devshell/worktree/main.py`, not from the help text:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `fx worktree add <name>` | Lease a pool slot and expose it as `<name>`. Auto-provisions a new physical checkout if the pool is empty. Opts: `--sync`, `--pool-name <slot>`, `--json`. |
| `fx worktree list` | Active worktrees and their git branches. |
| `fx worktree locate <name>` | Absolute path to the worktree on disk (the *physical* slot). |
| `fx worktree remove <name>` | Remove the worktree and return the slot to the pool. |
| `fx worktree pool list` | Physical checkouts in the pool, with state and paths. |
| `fx worktree pool add [name]` | Add a physical checkout. Opts: `--set '<args>'` (runs `fx set`), `--symlink-local` / `--copy-local` (bring the main checkout's `local/` dir across). |
| `fx worktree pool remove <name> [--force]` | Delete a physical checkout. |

**Trap: the help text advertises commands that do not exist.** `tools/devshell/worktree.fx` lists
`lease` and `release` in its header, and `fx worktree --help` omits `pool` from the command list.
The argparse surface in `main.py` is authoritative: `pool`, `locate`, `list`, `add`, `remove` — there
is no `lease`/`release`. Leasing happens implicitly inside `add`/`remove`.

### Layout

```
$FUCHSIA_DIR/.jiri_root/worktrees/<name>   -> symlink to the pool slot
$FUCHSIA_DIR/.jiri_root/worktrees/<slot>   physical checkout, auto-named e.g. "neat-thicket"
$FUCHSIA_DIR/.jiri_root/worktrees_registry plain text, one physical slot path per line
```

`fx worktree add usb` creates the symlink `usb` → an adjective-noun slot name generated from a word
list in `worktree_pool.py`. `fx` resolves through the symlink and bakes the **stable name** into
build paths (`.jiri_root/worktrees/usb/out/...`), so the slot underneath can change without
invalidating the build dir.

Worktrees come up on **detached HEAD**, despite `add`'s argument help calling it
"Name of worktree / branch". Create a branch yourself if you want one.

### Cost model — worktrees are about lifecycle, not disk

*Verified:* a worktree does **not** share `prebuilt/` with the parent tree. The files are at
different inodes and free space drops by the full amount.

| | Disk |
|---|---|
| `fx worktree` slot | ~30 GB (own 25 GB `prebuilt/`) + its build dir |
| Separate full checkout | ~44 GB+ (own prebuilt *and* own git objects) |

Real savings, but ~30% — not the near-free duplication the layout suggests. **Choose `fx worktree`
because one `jiri update` keeps every workstream on a consistent revision and slots are managed as a
pool**, not to save space. The failure mode it fixes is N hand-maintained checkouts silently drifting
to N different revisions.

### Workflow

```bash
cd "$FUCHSIA_DIR"
fx worktree add <topic>                       # provisions ~30 GB on first use — heavy
cd "$(fx worktree locate <topic>)"            # or cd .jiri_root/worktrees/<topic>
fx set <product>.<board> --debug --ccache
fx set-device <device-or-emu>                 # NOT `ffx target default set`
fx build
```

`fx set` and `fx build` behave normally inside a worktree; the build dir is an ordinary `out/` inside
it. To retire a workstream: `fx worktree remove <topic>` returns the slot for reuse.

## The two conventions (this is the whole trick)

These apply to worktrees and separate checkouts alike.

1. **Targets:** use `fx set-device <name>` — it stores the default **per build dir**
   (`out/<dir>.device`, surfaced to ffx as `$FUCHSIA_NODENAME`). Do **not** use
   `ffx target default set`: current trees removed the command outright and bypass stateful
   `target.default` config entirely (fxbug.dev/394619603); on older checkouts it writes a **shared**
   user-level default that overrides every tree. Clear a stale value with
   `ffx config remove target.default`.
2. **Emulators:** always pass a unique name: `fx ffx emu start --name <topic>-emu …`. Emulator
   instances live under `~/.local/share/Fuchsia/ffx/emu/instances/<name>`, are keyed by name only,
   and are shared across every tree — two workstreams both using `fuchsia-emulator` corrupt each
   other. This is the one genuinely shared piece of ffx state.

**Default build flags — `--debug --ccache`.** Debug mode (assertions on, full symbols) suits driver
work, and ccache speeds rebuilds. Pass `--ccache` *explicitly*: Fuchsia only auto-enables it when
`CCACHE_DIR` is set, and the default compilation mode is `balanced`. Requires `ccache` installed. The
build dir encodes the mode (`out/<product>.<board>-debug`) and the default device is per-build-dir,
so re-run `fx set-device` if you switch modes.

## Why it works (per-build-dir isolation)

Already isolated per build dir — no action needed. *Citations reflect the tree as of 2026-06; verify
if behaviour differs.*

| Concern | Where | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Which tree `fx`/`ffx` act on | resolved from **cwd** (`.fx-root` walk); `$FUCHSIA_DIR` ignored; `$PATH`-invoked binary auto-redirects into the cwd's tree | `scripts/fx:188-228`, `src/developer/ffx/scripts/ffx` |
| ffx daemon socket | `out/<dir>/.ffx-daemon/daemon.sock` | `config/src/paths.rs:87-99` |
| ffx build config (product bundle, repo, qemu/sdk overrides) | `out/<dir>/ffx-config.json` | `config/.../context.rs:354-383` |
| default target device | `out/<dir>.device` → `$FUCHSIA_NODENAME` | `tools/devshell/set-device`, `lib/vars.sh:444` |
| default target resolution | `-t` flag, else `$FUCHSIA_DEVICE_ADDR`/`$FUCHSIA_NODENAME`; stateful `target.default` **bypassed** | `ffx/lib/target/src/lib.rs:690-714` |
| build lock | `out/<dir>.build_lock` | `lib/vars.sh:500` |

The remaining single-tree assumption is the **shell environment**: a typical `~/.bashrc` pins one
tree's `.jiri_root/bin` onto `PATH` and sources its `fx-env.sh`, so another shell inherits the wrong
tools and survives only via the cwd-redirect. Worktrees do **not** fix this — see `fx-tree env` below.

## Do NOT use `FFX_ISOLATE_DIR` / `--isolate-dir` as a per-tree switch

Tempting but **wrong**. Isolate mode flips ffx to `EnvironmentKind::Isolated`, which has no
`build_dir`, so ffx stops loading `out/<dir>/ffx-config.json` (product bundle, repository, qemu/sdk
overrides) — breaking `fx ffx emu`, `fx serve`, and product-bundle resolution. It is for hermetic
tests, not day-to-day multi-tree dev. (Overriding `XDG_*` is also wrong: it leaks into every other
XDG-aware tool.) The per-build-dir isolation above is what you want.

## Legacy: separate full checkouts and the `fx-tree` helper

Still valid, and still what most existing trees are. Use it for trees that predate `fx worktree`, or
when a workstream genuinely needs its own integration revision (e.g. keeping a known-good bench tree
pinned while another moves forward).

`fx-tree` lives in this skill's directory; symlink it onto `$PATH` if you like
(`ln -s <skill-dir>/fx-tree ~/.local/bin/fx-tree`).

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `eval "$(fx-tree env)"` | Point the **current shell** at the tree your cwd is in: strips other trees' `.jiri_root/bin` from `PATH`, prepends this one's, sets `FUCHSIA_DIR`, adds an `[fx:<tree>]` prompt tag. **Still useful with worktrees** — this is the shell-env gap nothing else closes. |
| `fx-tree doctor` | Diagnose multi-tree hazards (PATH/`FUCHSIA_DIR`, per-build-dir device + daemon, shared user-level default target, emulator-name collisions). |
| `fx-tree list` | All checkouts under `$FX_TREE_ROOTS` (default `~/src`): build dir / device / daemon state. |
| `fx-tree new NAME [opts]` | **Superseded by `fx worktree add`** for new workstreams. Still the tool if you need a genuinely independent checkout. Dry-run by default; `--run` to execute. |
| `fx-tree shim [DIR]` | Drop a `.envrc` (`eval "$(fx-tree env)"`) into a tree and git-exclude it (for direnv). |

## What changed, and why the old advice was wrong

Earlier versions of this skill said **do not use git worktrees**, because `git worktree add` only
materializes git-tracked files while Fuchsia's heavy parts (`prebuilt/`, `.jiri_root/`,
`integration/`) are gitignored, so a worktree came up missing all of it.

That reasoning was correct; upstream simply solved it. `fx worktree` does not create a bare git
worktree — it calls `jiri worktree add`, which provisions a **complete checkout** as a pool slot.
The gitignored parts are materialized per slot rather than shared, which is exactly why the disk
cost is ~30 GB rather than near-zero.

## Note for the agent

- **Verify the command surface against the tree in front of you.** `worktree.fx`'s header and
  `--help` both disagree with the implemented subcommands; read `tools/devshell/worktree/main.py`.
- `fx worktree add` provisions ~30 GB on first use — heavy, confirm-first. So is `fx-tree new --run`.
- `fx worktree` requires a recent tree. On an older checkout the answer is `jiri update` first; before
  running it, sweep **every** project for local work (`jiri runp -show-name-prefix git status
  --porcelain`), not just the root repo — local commits and dirty files hide in `third_party/*`.
- `jiri update` defaults to `-gc=true`, which deletes projects that left the manifest. If a project
  carrying local branches has moved path upstream, that work goes with it. Use `-gc=false` on the
  first pass after a long gap.
- `jiri update` will not move a project that is sitting on a local branch. Detach (`git checkout
  --detach JIRI_HEAD`) any project you want updated, or the tree looks updated while the projects
  you care about silently stay behind.
- The `fx-tree env` output is shell code meant to be `eval`'d — emitting it without eval just prints
  the snippet.
